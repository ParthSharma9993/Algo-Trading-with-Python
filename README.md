Automated Trading System with Python for Stock
📖 Description
This repository contains a robust algorithmic trading system built with Python, designed for real-time trade execution in the Stock market. The system automates the process of data fetching, signal generation using a pre-trained model, and order placement. It's built to be modular and easy to manage, with a clear separation of concerns for each part of the trading pipeline.

✨ Features
Live Trading Execution: The live_trader.py script acts as the core of the system, running a continuous loop to manage trading activities.

Machine Learning Integration: Uses a pre-trained model, saved with joblib, to generate trading signals.

Persistent Position Tracking: Automatically restores open positions from a log file (trade_logs/positions.csv) to ensure continuity even after restarting the script.

Modular Scripts: The scripts directory contains separate modules for key functionalities, including data fetching (fetch_data.py), model training (train_model.py), and data visualization (plot_advanced.py).

Configuration: Key trading parameters like SYMBOLS, SLEEP_SECONDS, and POSITION_SIZE are easily configurable at the top of the live_trader.py script.

Dependency Management: A requirements.txt file and a dedicated virtual environment (Stock_venv) are included for easy setup.

⚙️ Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Python (3.8 or higher)

pip (Python package installer)

🔧 Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Activate the virtual environment:
The project uses a virtual environment named Stock_venv.

# On Windows
Stock_venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source Stock_venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Getting Started
Prepare your data and model:

Use train_model.py to train your machine learning model and save it as my_model.joblib in the models/ directory.

Ensure your historical data is available in the data/ directory.

Configure the live trader:
Open scripts/live_trader.py and adjust the configuration settings at the top, such as the SYMBOLS list to define the assets you want to trade and POSITION_SIZE for your risk management.

Run the live trading script:
With your virtual environment active, execute the main trading script.

python scripts/live_trader.py

The script will begin its trading loop and will automatically log all trading activities to the trade_logs/ directory.
